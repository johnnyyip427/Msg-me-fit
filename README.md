#MSG ME FIT

[Demo](http://msg-me-fit.herokuapp.com/)

##Purpose
Prior to creating this app, we saw that often times, bodybuilders were on their phones throughout their workouts scrambling to figure out which exercise to work on next. We quickly found out that meal prepping caused similar problems, albeit at home instead of at the gym. As a result, we decided to move forward with an application that solves both of these problems by allowing users to pre-plan both their workout routines and meal plans. 

##What it does
We designed this application as a fitness planning tool used to plan meals, schedules workouts, and notify users of their upcoming events. Leveraging several technologies, we built the app with useful features for bodybuilders of all levels.

##Profile: 
Users can add their lifting statistics (weight, bench press, deadlift, squat, etc.) and see their linear progression over time. In addition, all of the user's scheduled events will be listed and organized underneath.
